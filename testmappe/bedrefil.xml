  Meteorological data measured at Tara ice camp
  Data were collected using Aanderaa automatic weather station fixed on a 10 m 
met. mast at the drfting Tara ice camp during September 2006 until December 
2007. Data for every month are presented in separate files. Tara drifted on the 
Arctic Ocean starting north from Severnaya Zemlya up to 88 degN and finishing in 
Fram Strait east from Greenland. For a complete review of the measurements see
