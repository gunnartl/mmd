  <mmd:abstract xml:lang="en">
Arctic Ocean Experiment 2001 AOE-2001 was an icebreaker based field experiment 
with a target on the formation of low clouds in the central Arctic summer during 
July and August 2001. A main portion of the 2-moth experiment was a 3-week ice 
drift from 89 to 88 degN. Main components of the meteorology part of the 
experiment were surface-based remote- sensing observations, general meteorology 
observations (weather staion and soundings) and boundary-layer observations on 
the ice. For a complete review of the experiment and a full list of instruments, 
see Tjernstr√∂m et al. 2004 ("The summertime Arctic atmosphere: Meteorological 
measurements during the Arctic Ocean Experiment (AOE-2001)" in Bulletin of the 
American Meteorological Society, 85, 1305 - 1321, and its on-line supplement 
"Experimental equipment: A supplement to The summertime Arctic atmosphere: 
Meteorological measurements during the Arctic Ocean Experiment (AOE-2001)"). 
Observations included in the dataset:
   Observations from 2D-wind sonic anemometer on the mast of Oden during AOE-2001. Beware of flow distortion from the ship.
   One-hour averaged cloud base observations from cloud base lidar and cloud radar during AOE-2001
   Instant cloud-top observations from S-band cloud radar operating in two modes, a low-range high-resolution and a high-range low-resolution mode, respectively, obtained during AOE-2001. The presented data is the highest cloud top altitude observed.
   Various meteorological observations from a mast placed on an ice-floe during AOE-2001
   Turbulence statistics from sonic anemometer at 15 meters on the mast averaged over 15 minute obtained during AOE-2001
   Turbulence statistics from sonic anemometer at 5 meters on the mast averaged over 15 minute obtained during AOE-2001
   Various meteorological observations from Odens weather station situated at 35 metres ASL during AOE-2001. Winds may be subject to considerable flow distortion. Precipitation is in arbitrary units.
   One-hour averaged precipitation from present-weather-sensor, which measures no. of precip particles falling past the sensor, during AOE-2001
   Wind profile data from 915 MHz profiler on foredeck of Oden obtained during AOE-2001
   Atmospheric baloon sounding data obtained during AOE-2001. The observations are interpolated to a fixed grid for plotting purposes.
   Measurements from the high range of the S-band cloud radar obtained during AOE-2001. The variables presented are radar reflectivity and hydro-meteor fall velocity.
   Measurements from the low range of the S-band cloud radar obtained during AOE-2001. The variables presented are radar reflectivity and hydro-meteor fall velocity.
   Temperature profiles measured by a scanning radiometer obtained during AOE-2001.
   Measurements from the sodar obtained during AOE-2001. Note that the altitude for each record varies in time.
   Observations 5 metres AGL from mobile ISSF PAM station 1 during AOE-2001.
   Turbulence observations 5 metres AGL from mobile ISSF PAM station 1 during AOE-2001.
   Observations 5 metres AGL from mobile ISSF PAM station 2 during AOE-2001.
   Turbulence observations 5 metres AGL from mobile ISSF PAM station 1 during AOE-2001.
   Observations 5 metres AGL from mobile ISSF PAM station 3 during AOE-2001.
   Turbulence observations 5 metres AGL from mobile ISSF PAM station 1 during AOE-2001.
   One-hour averaged visibility observations from back-scatter sensor during AOE-2001.
